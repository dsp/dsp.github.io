# A Brief History of Source Control Management Systems

Source Control Management Systems (SCM) have a long and rich history. They have evolved from the minimalistic tools of the past, to the modern complex machineries, that power the foundries of modern software development. While some conservatives still cherish the puristic view of Folder-1 to Folder-142, the times of banging rocks together and distributing tarballs and patches have passed.
 
## Ancient Times: SCCS, RCS
Before SCCS there was nothingness. In the year 0 BVCS (before version control, 1973 AC) [Marc Rochkind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Rochkind) looked upon the chaos of nothingness and swallowed lines of code. In anguish, he screamed. SCCS was born. Where there was chaos, there now was order.

In 1982 a young Walter Tichy decided that **order** must be German. RCS was created.

Little else is known of the ancient times. Many of the sources have not survived the natural disasters of the times (erroneous disk blocks, broken tapes, memory corruption) and frequent raids of `rm`, `fsck` and other tools.

## The Dark Age: CVS, Visual SourceSafe, ClearCase
In 1990, Grune, Baalberge and Waage, [cycling through Amsterdam to their homes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_LSD#%22Bicycle_Day%22). As the colours shifted, the shapes altered in a fantastic kaleidoscope of the cosmos, and the concurrency of time, they decided all things must be shared concurrently. With a heavy head they developed CVS the next morning

## The Renewers of the Middle Ages: SVN, Perforce
## The Enlightenment Era: BitKeeper, Monotone, Arch, Darcs
## The Modern Era: Bazaar, Mercurial, Git
## The Post-War Era: Git, Fossil, Pijul
## The Future: The missing version control system
