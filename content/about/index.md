# about

I am David Soria Parra, I am a Member of Technical Staff at Anthropic.

I have a rich history in developing and maintaining open source
software. I've actively contributed to the [PHP programming language](https://php.net)
as a core developer and was responsible for the official releases
of PHP 5.4 and PHP 5.5. I actively contributed to [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org)
and developed key features within Mercurial such as bookmarks, pager,
shelving and more.

Between 2013 and 2017 I was a software engineer at Facebook's
developer infrastructure team. From 2017 I managed increasingly
larger teams and organisation within Facebook, with a particular
focus on extending our internal tools to new development areas such
as VR, AR and ASIC development.  In 2021, I moved to London where
I lead an organisation of 45+ people across multiple managers,
focusing Static Analysis and Simulation-based Testing teams.

In 2023 I was an enterpreneur in residence at [Sutter Hill
Ventures](https://shv.com) in London.

I joined Anthropic in April 2024. I am the co-creator of the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
